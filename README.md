# HammingCodeSimulator

A Hamming Code Simulator using Java.
-------------------------------------
The purpose of the Hamming Code Simulator is to detect and correct flipped bits (a 1 becoming a 0 and vice versa) within bits in binary data.
This allows for the sending and storing of data with lower risk of data corruption.
